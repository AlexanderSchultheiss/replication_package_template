Please refer to [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for the requirements of the two different setups.

## Installation - Running the Experiments with Docker
The following installation instructions apply, if you plan to run the experiments presented in our paper __with__ Docker.

### Installation Instructions
In the following, we describe how to build the Docker image and run the experiments in Docker containers.

* First, open a suitable terminal.
```
Windows Command Prompt: 
 - Press 'Windows Key + R' on your keyboard

### Validation of Correct Installation
We prepared an entry point for the Docker image through which you can validate that the image is working. This validation 
comprises a small subset of the experiments which we present in our paper. 

Running the full validation should take around 30 minutes (+- 15 minutes depending on your system). You can start it by ...

You can cancel the process at any time by ...
Stopping the execution may take a short while.
If your system supports neither `batch` nor `bash`, you can instead execute the following:
...


### Expected Output
During the execution, the container will print information about each completed experimental run. This output should look 
_similar_ to this:
...
