# RaQuN (Range Queries on N input models)

RaQuN is a scalable n-way model matching algorithm, which uses multi-dimensional search trees for efficiently finding suitable
matching candidates through range queries. This repository comprises the artifacts for our paper
_Scalable N-Way Model Matching Using Multi-Dimensional Search Trees_ which we presented at the
International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages 2021
([MODELS 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2021)).

## Requirements and Installation

___This is a quickstart guide. For a detailed step-by-step guide please refer to [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) and
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). There you can also find the specific Docker commands that are executed by the scripts below.___

### Setup Instructions
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system and start the [Docker Daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/).
* Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory
* Build the docker image by calling the build script corresponding to your OS
  ```shell
  # Windows:
  build-docker-image.bat
  # Linux | MacOS:
  build-docker-image.sh
  ```
* You can validate the installation by calling the validation corresponding to your OS. The validation should take about
  `30 minutes` depending on your system.
  ```shell
  # Windows:
  experiment.bat validate
  # Linux | MacOS:
  experiment.sh validate
  ```
  The script will generate figures and tables similar to the ones presented in our paper. They are automatically saved to
  `./results/eval-results`.

## Running the Experiments Using Docker

___This is a quickstart guide. For a detailed step-by-step guide and instructions for
running the experiments without Docker please refer to [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md). There you can also find the specific Docker commands that are executed by the scripts below.___

**ATTENTION**
```
! Before running or re-running any experiments:
! Make sure to delete all previously collected results by deleting the `./results` directory, as they will otherwise be 
! counted as results of parallel experiment executions. We only append results data, not overwrite it, to make it 
! possible to run multiple instances of the same experiment in parallel.
```

* All of the commands in this section are assumed to be executed in a terminal with working directory at RaQuN's project
  root.
* You can stop the execution of any experiment by running the following command in another terminal:
  ```shell
  # Windows Command Prompt:
  stop-all-experiments.bat
  # Windows PowerShell:
  .\stop-all-experiments.bat
  # Linux | MacOS
  ./stop-all-experiments.sh
  ```
Stopping the execution may take a moment.

[comment]: <> (* You can find more detailed information on how to run and configure the experiments with and without Docker in [EXPERIMENTS.md]&#40;EXPERIMENTS.md&#41;.)

### Running all Experiments
You can repeat the experiments exactly as presented in our paper. The following command will execute 30 runs of the experiments
for RQ1 and RQ2, and 1 run for the experiment of RQ3.
```shell
# Windows Command Prompt:
experiment.bat run
# Windows PowerShell:
.\experiment.bat run
# Linux | MacOS
./experiment.sh run
```
```
Expected Average Runtime for all experiments (@2.90GHz): 2460 hours or 102 days.

We provide instructions on how to parallelize the experiments for a shorter total runtime in the next sections.
```

### Running Specific Experiments
Due to the considerable runtime of running all experiments in a single container, we offer possibilities to run
individual experiments and repetitions of specific experiments in parallel.
You can run a single experiment repetition for any of the RQs (e.g., `experiment.bat RQ1` executes RQ1). If you want to
run multiple containers in parallel, you simply have to open a new terminal and start the experiment there as well.
```shell
# Windows Command Prompt:
experiment.bat (RQ1|RQ2|RQ3)  
# Windows PowerShell:
.\experiment.bat (RQ1|RQ2|RQ3)
# Linux | MacOS
./experiment.sh (RQ1|RQ2|RQ3)
```
#### Runtime
`Expected Average Runtime for one Repetition of RQ1 (@2.90GHz): 4 hours` (Repeated 30 times for the paper)

`Expected Average Runtime for one Repetition of RQ2 (@2.90GHz): 8 hours` (Repeated 30 times for the paper)

`Expected Average Runtime for one Repetition of RQ3 (@2.90GHz): 2100 hours or 87 days` (Repeated 1 time for the paper)

#### Running RQ3 on Specific ArgoUML Subsets
Due to the large runtime of RQ3, we made it possible to run the experiments on individual subsets in parallel. There
are 30 subsets for each subset size. You can filter these subsets for the experiment by providing a `SUBSET_ID`. `SUBSET_ID`
has to be a natural number in the interval `[1, 30]` (e.g., `experiment.bat RQ3 1` will run RQ for all subsets with ID 1).
Hereby, you can start multiple Docker containers in
parallel.
```shell
# Windows Command Prompt:
experiment.bat RQ3 SUBSET_ID  
# Windows PowerShell:
.\experiment.bat RQ3 SUBSET_ID  
# Linux | MacOS
./experiment.sh RQ3 SUBSET_ID
```

#### Runtime
`Expected Average Runtime for one Repetition of RQ3 With a Specific SUBSET_ID (@2.90GHz): 70 hours`
(Repeated 1 time for each of the 30 valid `SUBSET_ID`)

```
We ran the experiments in parallel on a compute server with 240 CPU cores (2.90GHz) and 1TB RAM. 
For RQ1 and RQ2, we set the number of repetitions to 2, for RQ3 to 1. Then, we executed the following sequential steps:
  - 15 parallel executions of RQ1 by calling 'experiment.(sh|bat) RQ1' in 15 different terminal sessions.
  - 15 parallel executions of RQ2 by calling 'experiment.(sh|bat) RQ2' in 15 different terminal sessions.
  - 30 parallel executions of RQ3 by calling 'experiment.(sh|bat) RQ3 SUBSET_ID' with the 30 different SUBSET_IDs in 
    different terminal sessions
The total runtime was about 3-4 days.
```

### Result Evaluation
You can run the result evaluation by calling the experiment script with `evaluate`. The
script will consider all data found under `./results`.
```shell
# Windows Command Prompt:
experiment.bat evaluate
# Windows PowerShell:
.\experiment.bat evaluate  
# Linux | MacOS
./experiment.sh evaluate
```
`Expected Average Runtime for all experiments (@2.90GHz): a few seconds`
The script will generate figures and tables similar to the ones presented in our paper. They are automatically saved to
`./results/eval-results`.

### Docker Experiment Configuration
By default, the properties used by Docker are configured to run the experiments as presented in our paper. We offer the
possibility to change the default configuration.
* Open the properties file which you want to adjust
    * [`full-experiments.properties`](docker-resources/full-experiments.properties) configures the experiment execution
      of `experiment.(bat|sh) run`
    * [`single-experiment.properties`](docker-resources/single-experiment.properties) configures specific experiment runs
      with `experiment.(bat|sh) (RQ1|RQ2|RQ3)`
* Change the properties to your liking
* Rebuild the docker image as described in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
* Delete old results in the `./results` folder
* Start the experiment as described above.

__You can find instructions on how to run the experiments on your own datasets in [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md).__

### Clean-Up
The more experiments you run, the more space will be required by Docker. The easiest way to clean up all Docker images and
containers afterwards is to run the following command in your terminal. Note that this will remove all other containers and images
not related to RaQuN as well:
```
docker system prune -a
```
Please refer to the official documentation on how to remove specific [images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_rm/) and [containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_rm/) from your system.

## Using RaQuN as a Library in Your Own Projects
You can also use RaQuN as a Java Library in your own project. To do so, you will have to prepare your system the same way
as for running the experiments without Docker. Please refer to the [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) and [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
for instructions on how to do so. Once prepared, you can build a JAR file containing RaQuN using Maven:
* Execute the following a terminal with working directory in the project's root folder:
  ````shell
  mvn package 
  ````
* You can then find the JAR file containing RaQuN and all its dependencies as a library under `./target/RaQuN-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
* Please refer to the documentation of your IDE or build system for instructions on how to add JARs as
  dependencies.

### Examples
#### Matching a Dataset Stored in CSV Format
The following presents a simple example on how to compute a matching for a dataset with RaQuN:
```java
import java.util.Set;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.RaQuN;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.data.RMatch;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.data.RDataset;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.similarity.WeightMetric;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.validity.OneToOneValidity;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.vectorization.PropertyBasedVectorization;

import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        var dataset = new RDataset("MyDataset");
        dataset.loadFileContent(Paths.get("path/to/MyDataset.csv"));
        
        RaQuN raQuN = new RaQuN(new PropertyBasedVectorization(), new OneToOneValidity(), new WeightMetric());
        Set<RMatch> matching = raQuN.match(dataset.getModels());
    }
}
```

#### Matching a Dataset Created with Raw Data
The following presents a simple example on how you can initialize the models of a dataset in code, and then match them
with RaQuN:
```java
import java.util.Set;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.RaQuN;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.data.RElement;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.data.RMatch;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.data.RModel;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.similarity.WeightMetric;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.validity.OneToOneValidity;
import de.variantsync.matching.raqun.vectorization.PropertyBasedVectorization;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Set<RModel> models = new HashSet<>();
        
        RModel modelA = new RModel("A");
        modelA.addElement(new RElement("A", "X0","Element-1", Collections.singletonList("prop1, prop2")));
        modelA.addElement(new RElement("A", "X1","Element-2", Collections.singletonList("prop3, prop4")));
        models.add(modelA);

        RModel modelB = new RModel("B");
        modelB.addElement(new RElement("B", "X0","Element-1", Collections.singletonList("prop1, prop2, prop3")));
        modelB.addElement(new RElement("B", "X1","Element-2", Collections.singletonList("prop3, prop4")));
        models.add(modelB);
        
        RaQuN raQuN = new RaQuN(new PropertyBasedVectorization(), new OneToOneValidity(), new WeightMetric());
        Set<RMatch> matching = raQuN.match(models);
    }
}
```
