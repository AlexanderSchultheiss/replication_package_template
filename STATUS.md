# Status
We apply for the _Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable_ and _Artifacts Available_ badges.

## Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable
We believe that the artifact deserves this badge because
* we documented all code artifacts ([./docs](docs), [GitHub Pages](https://alexanderschultheiss.github.io/RaQuN/docs/)) 
  and provide extensive instructions and examples on how to
  * [prepare the system](REQUIREMENTS.md) 
  * [install the artifacts](INSTALL.md)
  * [run the experiments](README.md)
  * [configure the experiments](EXPERIMENTS.md)
  * [use RaQuN as a library](README.md)
* the artifacts comprise all [source code](src/main/java/de/variantsync/matching) and [data](experimental_subjects) necessary to reproduce the experiments in the paper
* the artifacts comprise [instructions](EXPERIMENTS.md) that allow for easy reproduction of the experiments with and without Docker
* the artifacts comprise all [source code](result_analysis_python), [data](reported-results.zip), and [instructions](EXPERIMENTS.md) necessary to evaluate the experimental results and generate
      the plots and tables presented in the paper
* the artifacts comprise [instructions](INSTALL.md) on how to quickly install and validate a Docker image that runs the experiments

## Artifacts Available
